# Hello there, I'm Rodrigo... ðŸ‘‹
**...but you can call me Rods!**
I'm a fullstack developer and sometimes I like to think I'm a bit of designer too (I just fake it well). I'm passionate about building solid backends with a beaultiful look for users on the front.


<h2 align="center">Professional Experience</h2>
<p align="center">Most of my professional experience is in developing web applications with .NET and .NET Core. I mainly use SQL Server and MySQL for databases, and I've worked with all kind of frontends, from plain css to powerful frameworks like Angular. On the infra side, I used AWS for deployments, maneged S3 buckets, and set up Linux VPSs on different hosting plataforms.</p>

<h2 align="right">Always Learning</h2>
<p align="right">I believe that for IT professionals, learning is always a work in progress, picking up new things and practicing what we already know. This space will reflact that. Whether it's professional or study projects, rebuilding familiar ideas or trying out something new, creating great or even better projects, thats my journey.</p>
